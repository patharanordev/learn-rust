# Setup CLI

## CLIs

- cargo — **Rust package manager and build tool**, build system and dependency manager for Rust projects. It handles compiling, testing, running, and managing dependencies.
- rustc — **Rust compiler**, the actual compiler that takes your .rs (Rust source) files and turns them into machine code (binaries or libraries)
- rustup — **Rust toolchain manager**, manages different versions of the compiler (rustc), Cargo, and related tools.

## Platforms

### Linux & macOS

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Windows OS

Please refer to [rustup-init.exe](https://win.rustup.rs/).

## Update toolchain

```sh
rustup update stable
```

## Install & Verify platform target

Sometime you may need tool to support on your target platform. You can check available platform framework via CLI below:

```sh
rustup target list
```

then install your target:

```sh
rustup target add <TARGET_NAME>
```
