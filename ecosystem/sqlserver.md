# SQLServer

## Recommended libraries

- SQLx
  - v0.6.x below supports SQL Server, please refer to [sqlx-oldapi](https://github.com/sqlpage/sqlx-oldapi). There's a fork of 0.6 being maintained by an outside contributor that is not associated with us, it still has the MSSQL driver, [ref. abonander](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/discussions/1616#discussioncomment-10789807).
  - v0.7.x does not support SQL Server, the driver used in [new project SQLx Pro](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/discussions/1616)
